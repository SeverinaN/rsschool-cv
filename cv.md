### **About me**
I started my career as a software engineer at EPAM with an external course. Three months later I successfully moved to EPAM Lab and soon started working on the project as a Java/AEM developer.

I worked very hard to get my place. A month later, when I started learning how to work with AEM and learning basic things about it, I got my first job. AEM always uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS in its functionality. As a Java/AEM developer, I need to know JavaScript to be successful.

At my university I worked with HTML/CSS/JavaScript but now I feel like I need more knowledge in JS and I think I can improve this skill for my job.
